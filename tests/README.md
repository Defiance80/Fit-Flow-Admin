## Test Data

Tests use Laravel's factory system to generate test data:
- User factories for user-related tests
- Course factories for course-related tests
- Order factories for order-related tests
- And factories for all other models

## Database

Tests use an in-memory SQLite database for fast execution:
- Database is refreshed before each test
- Seeders are run to populate initial data
- No external database dependencies

## Mocking

Tests use Mockery for mocking external services:
- Firebase services
- Payment gateways
- Email services
- File storage services

## Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test is independent and doesn't affect others
2. **Clear Naming**: Test methods clearly describe what they're testing
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All public methods and edge cases are tested
4. **Fast Execution**: Tests run quickly using in-memory database
5. **Maintainable**: Tests are easy to understand and maintain

## Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed to run in CI/CD pipelines:
- No external dependencies
- Fast execution
- Clear pass/fail status
- Coverage reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Ensure SQLite is available
   - Check database configuration in phpunit.xml

2. **Memory Issues**
   - Increase memory limit in php.ini
   - Use `--process-isolation` flag

3. **Slow Tests**
   - Check for unnecessary database operations
   - Use factories instead of creating models manually

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the test output for specific error messages
2. Verify your environment setup
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Check the Laravel documentation for testing best practices
